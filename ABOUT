                     The Ultra-Cloud Project

The Ultra-Cloud Project is a collaborative software development effort
aimed at creating a robust, commercial-grade, featureful, and freely-available
source code implementation of the real-time distributed computing . The project is jointly 
managed by a group of volunteers located around the world, using the Internet
and the Web to communicate, plan, and develop the project and its related 
documentation.

How to become involved in the Ultra-cloud project

There are several levels of contributing. If you just want to send
in an occasional suggestion/fix, then you can just use the bug reporting
form at <https://github.com/osblinnikov/ultra-cloud/issues>. 
There's a lot of information about the development process 
to be found at <https://github.com/osblinnikov/ultra-cloud/issues>.

If you'd like to become an active contributor to the Ultra-cloud project (the
group of volunteers who vote on changes to the distributed server), then
you need to start by watching project.
We recommend reading the list of current and resolved issues for a while 
before trying to jump in to development.

The Utltra-cloud project is a meritocracy -- the more work you have done, the more
you are allowed to do. The group founders set the original rules, but
they can be changed by vote of the active members.

Changes to the code are proposed in a form of pull requests and usually voted on by active
members -- three +1 (yes votes) and no -1 (no votes, or vetoes) are needed
to commit a code change during a release cycle; docs are usually committed
first and then changed as needed, with conflicts resolved by majority vote.

We discuss new features to add, bug fixes, user problems, developments
in the web server community, release dates, etc. The actual code development
takes place on the developers' local machines, with proposed changes
communicated using a pull requests, and committed to the source repository by one of the core
developers.  Anyone on the watching list can vote on a
particular issue, but we only count those made by active members or people
who are known to be experts on that part of the project. Vetoes must be
accompanied by a convincing explanation.

New members of the Ultra-Cloud Group are added when a frequent contributor is
nominated by one member and unanimously approved by the voting members.
In most cases, this "new" member has been actively contributing to the
group's work for over six months, so it's an easy decision.

The above describes our past and current guidelines,
which will probably change over time as the membership of the group
changes and our development/coordination tools improve.

The Apache Software Foundation (www.apache.org)

The Apache Software Foundation exists to provide organizational, legal,
and financial support for the Apache open-source software projects.
Founded in June 1999 by the Apache Group, the Foundation has been
incorporated as a membership-based, not-for-profit corporation in order
to ensure that the Apache projects continue to exist beyond the participation
of individual volunteers, to enable contributions of intellectual property
and funds on a sound basis, and to provide a vehicle for limiting legal
exposure while participating in open-source software projects. 

You are invited to participate in The Apache Software Foundation. We welcome
contributions in many forms. Our membership consists of those individuals
who have demonstrated a commitment to collaborative open-source software
development through sustained participation and contributions within the
Foundation's projects. Many people and companies have contributed towards
the success of the Apache projects.

Why The Utlra-Cloud project Is Free

The Utlra-Cloud project exists to provide a robust and commercial-grade reference
implementation of actors framework for Real-time computations. It must remain a platform upon which
individuals and institutions can build reliable systems, both for
experimental purposes and for mission-critical purposes. We believe the
tools of real-time computations should be in the hands of everyone, and
software companies should make their money providing value-added services
such as specialized modules and support, amongst other things. We realize
that it is often seen as an economic advantage for one company to "own" a
market - in the software industry that means to control tightly a
particular conduit such that all others must pay. This is typically done
by "owning" the protocols through which companies conduct business, at the
expense of all those other companies. To the extent that the protocols of
the Real-time data processing remain "unowned" by a single company, the world will
remain a level playing field for companies large and small. Thus,
"ownership" of the protocols must be prevented, and the existence of a
robust reference implementation of the protocols, available absolutely for
free to all companies, is a tremendously good thing. 

Furthermore, Utlra-Cloud project is an organic entity; those who benefit from it
by using it often contribute back to it by providing feature enhancements,
bug fixes, and support for others in public newsgroups. The amount of
effort expended by any particular individual is usually fairly light, but
the resulting product is made very strong. This kind of community can
only happen with freeware -- when someone pays for software, they usually
aren't willing to fix its bugs. One can argue, then, that Ultra-Cloud's
strength comes from the fact that it's free, and if it were made "not
free" it would suffer tremendously, even if that money were spent on a
real development team.

We want to see Ultra-Cloud used very widely -- by large companies, small
companies, research institutions, schools, individuals, in the intranet
environment, everywhere -- even though this may mean that companies who
could afford commercial software, and would pay for it without blinking,
might get a "free ride" by using Ultra-Cloud. We would even be happy if 
some commercial software companies completely dropped their own
development plans and used Ultra-Cloud as a base, with the proper attributions
as described in the LICENSE file.

Thanks for using Ultra-Cloud Project!
