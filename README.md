The actors model suppose that every agent within the framework is a dynamic entity which can also create other entities. Parent actors can even serve only composition purpose without handling the actual workload. 

Ultra-Cloud project implements a restricted actors model. In real-time, embedded and distributed systems come to the fore the simpicity, robustness and possibility of the clear remote monitoring of the developed system . In this usecase of the actors model a topology of actors is very convinient for the system description and monitoring.

`ucl.yml` file is cornerstone in the ultra-cloud project. This file currently keeps the description of C, Java, JavaScript actor's internal structure and public interface.
